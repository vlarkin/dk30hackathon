## Managing Preview Environments with a Slack Bot

This solution provides a fully automated approach to managing preview environments for developers using a Slack bot. The bot integrates with the team's Slack channel and Argo CD tool to streamline the creation, tracking, and deletion of preview environments. Developers can efficiently manage their preview environments, ensuring they are always working with the most up-to-date application set versions and can easily clean up resources when they are no longer needed.

### Slack Bot Design

The Slack bot is designed to connect to the team's channel and interact with developers through a simple messenger interface. It allows users to initiate environment creation processes, check environment statuses, obtain unique links, and securely delete environments. The bot accepts three primary commands: create, get, and delete, and provides appropriate responses to each.

### Integration with GitOps Tools

The Slack bot is integrated with the Argo CD tool, which uses the application version control system to track the status of application set versions across different environments. This ensures that developers can preview and test the versions effectively.

### Slack Bot Commands

#### create
  
The `create` command allows users to create environments for specific application set versions, including all necessary services and ingress settings. When a user issues the `create` command, the bot will:  
  
Deploy a preview environment from the specified branch name with changes in the application set code.  
Provide information about the versions of the deployed application set.  
  
#### get
  
The `get` command enables users to retrieve a list of environments and their statuses. When a user issues the `get` command, the bot will:  
  
Return a list of current environments.  
Provide the status and versions of the deployed application sets.  
Provide a unique URL link to the ingress pointing to the frontend service of each application set.  
  
#### delete
  
The `delete` command allows users to securely delete environments after their use. When a user issues the `delete` command, the bot will:  
  
Perform all necessary actions to delete the specified environment with the application set.  
Confirm the successful completion of the deletion operation.
